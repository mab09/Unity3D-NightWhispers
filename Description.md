# Unity3D-NightWhispers

The main idea of this project is to make a virtual city during the night, which gives eerie atmosphere.
The player starts, at the edge of a city, the streets are completely empty, as he moves forward, he notices some shadowy figures following him.
The textures used were a mix of ones created by me, assets from a course and some downloaded from “freepbr.com”. The sounds were recorded by me except for the rain sounds which was downloaded from “freesound.org”. Also, the skybox here was obtained from “custommapmakers.org”.
This time I wanted to play around with navmeshes, it is used for the movement of the shadows. I wanted to make the city have a vertical block like in the movie “inception”, but I was not able to make the nav mesh link work with first person controller. Two assets were downloaded from the asset store, the trees (World Space Trees (FREE) – Shader by RRFREELANCE) and the streetlight (Urban Props by BISKIT) although the streetlight’s light source was separately implemented by me.
